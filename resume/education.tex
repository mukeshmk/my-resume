        {The algorithm selection problem characterizes the challenge of finding an effective algorithm for a given dataset on an instance-by-instance basis. FMLearn overcomes this time-consuming task by using historic performance data. A model is trained and is used to predict the best-performing algorithm for a previously seen or unseen dataset.}
