        Image and Audio captchas were parallelly generated, images were preprocessed using contour detection, and thresholding, and audio was converted to images using mel-spectrograms. This data was used to build a Convolutional Neural Network which achieved 93\% accuracy using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, matplotlib, etc.
