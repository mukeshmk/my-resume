        Image and Audio captchas were parallelly generated, images were preprocessed using contour detection, thresholding and audio was converted to images using mel-spectograms. This data was used to build a Convolutional Neural Network which achived 93\% accuracy using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, matplotlib, etc.

      {
      Inferential and Bayesian statistical techniques were applied to build a ML model in R on wine review dataset. Regression and Clustering analysis were performed to answer statistical questions. Sample data was generated with the help of Gibbs sampler on which MCMC tests were performed and results visualised using ggplot library.
